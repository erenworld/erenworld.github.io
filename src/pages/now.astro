    <p>
      <b>🖥️ Working:</b> I worked at a startup called Kolizeo over the past months.
      I enjoyed working close to real users and shipping things that actually mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🎨 Personal projects:</b> I&rsquo;m currently building SQLite from scratch.
      The goal is not to recreate a full database, but to deeply understand how things
      work under the hood: storage, paging, B-trees, persistence, and performance
      trade-offs. I&rsquo;m learning by reading articles, books, and by writing everything
      myself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>📚 Reading:</b> One page a day from <i>The Daily Stoic</i> by Ryan Holiday.
      It&rsquo;s a small daily habit that helps me stay grounded, especially during
      busy or unclear periods.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>⛰️ Spending time:</b> Mostly in Nancy, with friends. Simple things: watching
      movies, walking around the city, writing code, thinking, and drinking a lot
      of coffee.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🎶 Listening:</b> to a lot of Sade lately, and Turkish rock especially Şebnem
      Ferah and Yüzyüzeyken Konuşuruz. Music helps me focus when I code and disconnect
      when I don&rsquo;t.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🏍️ Watching:</b> I&rsquo;m watching <i>The Sopranos</i>. I really fell
      in love with the characters and the writing. The pace, the depth, the
      silence between scenes, everything feels intentional. Easily one of the
      best series I&rsquo;ve watched.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>👀 Looking forward to:</b> Having more quiet time for reading and writing,
      going deeper into my projects, and meeting curious people.
