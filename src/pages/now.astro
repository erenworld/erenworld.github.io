      <b>🖥️ Working:</b> I worked at a startup called Kolizeo over the past months.
      I enjoyed working close to real users and shipping things that actually mattered.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🎨 Personal projects:</b> I&rsquo;m currently building SQLite from scratch.
      The goal is not to recreate a full database, but to deeply understand how things
      work under the hood: storage, paging, B-trees, persistence, and performance
      trade-offs. I&rsquo;m learning by reading articles, books, and by writing everything
      myself.

      <b>📚 Reading:</b> One page a day from <i

        "
          >The Daily Stoic</a
        >
      </i> by Ryan Holiday. It&rsquo;s a small daily habit that helps me stay grounded,
      especially during busy or unclear periods.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>⛰️ Spending time:</b> Mostly in Nancy, with friends. Simple things: watching
      movies, walking around the city, writing code, thinking, and drinking a lot
      of coffee.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🎶 Listening:</b> to a lot of <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/47zz7sob9NUcODy0BTDvKx"
        >Sade</a
      > lately, and Turkish rock especially <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/74xBVPWYoSf5pvo5IkePRO"
        >Şebnem Ferah</a
      > and <a
        href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/7gobcoscOfsY0nOeqqFzvU"
      >
        Yüzyüzeyken Konuşuruz</a
      >. Music helps me focus when I code and disconnect when I don&rsquo;t.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>🏍️ Watching:</b> I&rsquo;m watching <i>
        <a
          href="https://www.hbomax.com/fr/fr/shows/sopranos/818c3d9d-1831-48a6-9583-0364a7f98453"
          >The Sopranos</a
        ></i
      >. I really fell in love with the characters and the writing. The pace,
      the depth, the silence between scenes, everything feels intentional.
      Easily one of the best series I&rsquo;ve watched.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>👀 Looking forward to:</b> Having more quiet time for reading and writing,
      going deeper into my projects, and meeting curious people.
