# How to get hired

<br />

Learn how to sell yourself.

## 1. Focus on one company

Learn everything about the company you are targeting. Read their blog.
Understand what they are currently building and the problems they are solving.
For example, the Cloudflare blog shows how their engineers approach real production issues, such as in How we found a bug in Go’s ARM64 compiler. Each article reflects a concrete way of thinking and problem-solving.

Identify the engineers behind this work. Reach out to them. Solve problems that matter to them. Improve their open-source codebases and submit meaningful pull requests. Avoid using AI for this step. Show real, hands-on skills.

## 2. Show them how much you want to work for them

Tell them, (in your own way), “You are my favorite company. It’s my dream to work for you. If you have any aspect that could use a little help, let me do it, and I promise you it’ll thrive. I’m that passionate about this.”

## 3. Be extraordinary

Resumes are boring. What really stands out is when someone is extraordinary. Build a personal brand on a very specific niche. Be like the expert of the field. Post daily on X. Build side projects who shows what you are capable of.

## 4. Be persistent

Combine phone, email, and in-person. You must use all three methods, since each has its strengths.
Always be succinct. Don’t take more than two minutes of their time. But always show your passion, and how much you can help them.
Do this every week. It’s OK to be almost annoying. Polite manners don’t prove passion.

> 💡 Do this until hired.
