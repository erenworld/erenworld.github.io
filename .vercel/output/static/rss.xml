&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mo42.bearblog.dev/read-to-forget/&quot;&gt;Read to Forget&lt;/a&gt; - I read a lot, and always find myself sometimes shuffling around to remember the details. But I like this frame of thinking, and it reminds me of how I&apos;ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb&quot;&gt;Taleb&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; books by letting the thoughts marinade in my head over a long period instead of highlighting everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stopa.io/post/297&quot;&gt;iPhone dumbphone&lt;/a&gt; - one of my favourite blogs, writing a post on something I love: people trying to make their phone use more intentional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleu-de-chauffe.com/en/&quot;&gt;bleu de chauffe&lt;/a&gt; - some beautiful bags and accessories made in France.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fontsinuse.com/&quot;&gt;Fonts in use&lt;/a&gt; - I searched up a font and stumbled on this, nice mood board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seangoedecke.com/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work/&quot;&gt;Do the simplest thing that could possibly work&lt;/a&gt; - I try to think this way when building systems, but it&apos;s actually much harder in practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin&quot;&gt;nix-darwin&lt;/a&gt; - creating a declarative OS intrigues me, because I like having all aspects of it expressed in clear text. Kinda like how I prefer having an &lt;code&gt;init.lua&lt;/code&gt; (my Neovim &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pzrsa/dotfiles/blob/main/nvim/init.lua&quot;&gt;config&lt;/a&gt;) that could be reproduced on other machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chillphysicsenjoyer.substack.com/p/youre-a-slow-thinker-now-what&quot;&gt;You&apos;re a Slow Thinker. Now what?&lt;/a&gt; - I think I&apos;m a mix of both a fast and slow thinker. I think fast in social interactions, but I struggle with quick mathematics on the spot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hope you enjoyed! do share anything you&apos;ve stumbled on recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried using &lt;a href=&quot;https://eren.substack.com/&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; as a way to just get my posts in peoples inboxes, but I didn&apos;t like how decoupled it was from my personal website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t like the idea of my posts lazily being posted around the internet, I want them to be in one canonical place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.com/&quot;&gt;Buttondown&lt;/a&gt;, I have a solution that should hopefully be less friction to send and easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all it took:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form
	action=&quot;https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/eren&quot;
	method=&quot;post&quot;
	target=&quot;_blank&quot;
&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input
	type=&quot;email&quot;
	name=&quot;email&quot;
	required
  /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&amp;gt;
   Subscribe
  &amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like to be one of the first subscribers, then please do share your email at the bottom of this post. It would truly mean a lot to me, and I hope to provide value for your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if you&apos;re like me and also enjoy using an RSS reader (I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://netnewswire.com/&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;), then you can stay updated by following my &lt;a href=&quot;rss.xml&quot;&gt;ATOM feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>how to grow a network from scratch (especially when you&apos;re young)</title><link>https://erenworld.github.io/grow-network/</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://erenworld.github.io/grow-network/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;before I joined Google in 2021, I was 17 years old, barely knew how to program and had no connections whatsoever in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but early on I learned the immense value of building a strong network, especially from scratch with complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this also went hand in hand with learning that having a referral (at least in the case of the tech industry), greatly improves the chances of your application being considered, given it literally falls in a recruiters lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m now 21, and over the past 4 years I feel like I&apos;ve built a pretty strong network, especially for someone who didn&apos;t have any connections initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been very intentional with it because I chose to have quality over quantity. in the case of linkedin, I only have ~160 connections, in contrast to people who spam their way to 500+ without any idea of the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not only am I &quot;connected&quot; with some fascinating people, I&apos;ve built genuine friendships with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, in this short post I&apos;ll be sharing some tips on how you could get your foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you&apos;re young, ambitious and somewhat outgoing, then I hope this will be of some value to you. I certainly would&apos;ve wanted a post like this a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this isn&apos;t some crazy voodoo advice to get your way, I&apos;m just some guy who knows how to make connections with people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find people similar to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be curious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being young lets you off the hook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;find people similar to you&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my parents are Persian, and I&apos;ve been made aware of how talented/vast we are when it comes to producing engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, naturally I pretty much only reached out to other Persians, since they&apos;d be more willing to help out one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you&apos;re not from a thick culture, then honestly it doesn&apos;t make a huge difference, just something you have less to connect on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;be curious&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one mistake so many people make is sending some generic message like &quot;hey, how&apos;s it going? I graduated at X so I&apos;m applying for Y, would you give me a referral?&quot;. you&apos;re probably thinking that this sounds so uninspired, but you&apos;d be surprised with how many messages I&apos;ve received with a similar tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember, &lt;strong&gt;you do not know this person&lt;/strong&gt;. show a reason why they should care for your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what I did was reach out to people who I knew had some interesting story or background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that could be a website, their resume/linkedin experience, their current company. there are so many things you can touch up on in your msg that sparks a curious conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember that the other person probably receives dozens of messages asking for referrals from desperate candidates, so don&apos;t send a generic msg further stating the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;being young lets you off the hook&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, I&apos;m not saying this for you to do dumb stuff and then say &quot;it&apos;s fine I&apos;m young&quot;, but I am also saying that being young lets you off the hook in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jokes aside in all honesty, if you&apos;re young, and by young I mean in your 20s, you literally have nothing to lose reaching out to strangers. in fact, it&apos;s the best chance for you to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve asked some silly questions to people, yet they find it quite endearing because of my age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one thing I learned from a teammate of mine at Google was to reach out to people 30+. because when they reach some sort of senior level, they feel like it&apos;s time for them to pay it forward to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in general though, this is just a fraction of the things I learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can really immerse in the filmmakers world, since you don&apos;t have to worry about making comments to your friends next to you. I can just let loose and let the film take me away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/don-cinema.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
(pic of me watching films alone)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean yeah you get some loud people in the theatre, but in general I watch films that attracts the type of crowd who appreciates the art of cinema, so are pretty respectful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&apos;m romanticising cinema, but most of my favourite films were watched alone. I just love it so much, so I look forward to the day I could take my child to the cinema for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&apos;s also worth mentioning not every film is fun to watch by yourself, there are films made to be watched with friends. I have so many priceless memories from those films, even the shitty ones I&apos;ve watched at home on the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lot of people are surprised to hear when I say I&apos;m watching a film alone, but I think it&apos;s generally because people are just not comfortable with their own presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so if you&apos;ve never done it before, I suggest you give it a go, it&apos;ll be a fun experience, and you&apos;ll probably meet some cool people!&lt;/p&gt;
